# Number Guessing Game - Java

This is a beginner-friendly number guessing game written in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it using console input via the `Scanner` class.

## How to Use

- Run the program.
- Enter your guess (a number between 1 and 100).
- The program will respond with a hint:
  - "Higher!" if your guess is too low.
  - "Lower!" if your guess is too high.
  - "You Win!" when you guess the correct number.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Interactive console input for user guesses.
- Provides feedback after each guess.
- Loops until the correct number is guessed.

## Concepts Used

- `Scanner` for user input
- `Random` for number generation
- `while` loop for repeated guesses
- `if-else` statements for conditional logic
